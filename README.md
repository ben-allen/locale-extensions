## Introduction

Unicode Extensions for BCP 47 can be used to append additional information needed to identify locales to the end of language identifiers. Enabling support for a subset of BCP tags can help solve problems like the ones below:

1. Currently en-US is the typical untranslated language for software, even though en-US's region-specific formatting patterns differ from those used globally. As a result, often text with untranslated UI strings will be displayed in a language accessible to all users who speak English, but with temperatures represented in Fahrenheit, a scale which is confusing and unfamiliar to users from regions that use Celcius. 

2. In many regions both Latin and Arabic-Indic numerals are in common use. Users in these regions may find one or the other of these numbering systems not immediately intelligible, and desire content tailored to the numbering system with which they are most familiar. 

For **client-side applications**, the best way to get these preferences is through a browser API that fetches this information from the different platform-specific APIs. 

For **server-side applications**, one way to access this information is through the use of a Client Hints header on the request signalling that Unicode Locale Extensions are to be used.  

### Common Locale Extensions
The following table suggests a minimal set of commonly used locale extensions to be supported. Note that the list of supported possible values for each extension is exhaustive &mdash; limiting the range of available options to a few sensible values helps mitigate privacy and security concerns related to providing servers with preferred content tailorings.

<table>
  <tr><td>"hourCycle"<td>`hc`<td>`h11`, `h23`, `auto`<td>Preferred hour cycle</tr>
  <tr><td>"numberingSystem"<td>`nu`<td>`latn`, `native`, `auto`<td>Preferred numbering system</tr>
  <tr><td>"measurementUnit"<td>`mu`<td>`celcius`, `fahrenheit`, `auto`<td>Measurement unit for temperature</tr>
  <thead><tr><th>Locale Extension Name<th>Unicode Extension Key<th>Possible values<th>Description</thead>
</table>


> Note: The full set of extensions ultimately included need to be validated and agreed to by security teams and stakeholders.


## Client Hints ##

An <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8942/">HTTP Client Hint</a> is a request header field that is sent by HTTP clients and used by servers to optimize content served to those clients. The Client Hints infrastructure defines an `Accept-CH` response header that servers can use to advertise their use of specific request headers for proactive content negotiation. This opt-in mechanism enables clients to send content adaptation data selectively, instead of appending all such data to every outgoing request. 

Because servers must specify the set of headers they are interested in receiving, the Client Hint mechanism eliminates many of the opportunities for hostile passive fingerprinting that arise when using other means for proactive content negotiation (for example, the `User-Agent` string). 


### `Client Hint` Header Fields

Servers cannot passively receive information about locale extension-related settings. Servers instead advertise their ability to use extensions, allowing clients the option to respond with their preferred content tailorings. 

To accomplish this, browsers should introduce new `Client Hint` header fields as part of a structured header as defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-19">Structured Field Values for HTTP</a>.

<table>
  <tr><td><dfn export>`Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-Hour-Cycle`</dfn><td>`Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-Hour-Cycle`  : "h23"</tr>
  <tr><td><dfn export>`Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-Numbering-System`</dfn><td>`Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-NumberingSystem`  : "native"</tr>
  <tr><td><dfn export>`Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-MeasurementUnit`</dfn><td>`Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-MeasurementUnit` : "auto"</tr>

  <thead><tr><th style=text:align left>Client Hint<th>Example output</thead>
</table>

The `Sec-` prefix used on these headers prevents scripts and other application content from setting them in user agents, and demarcates them as browser-controlled client hints so that they can be documented and included in requests without triggering CORS preflights. See [HTTP Client Hints Section 4.2, Deployment and Security Risks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8942#section-4.2) for more information. 

### Usage Example

<div class=example>

1. The client makes an initial request to the server:

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

2. The server responds, sending along with the initial response an `Accept-CH` header (see [HTTP Client Hints Section 3.1, The `Accept-CH` Response Header Field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8942#section-3.1)) with `Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-NumberingSystem`. This response indicates that the server accepts that particular Client Hint and no others. 

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Accept-CH: Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-NumberingSystem
```

3. Subsequent requests to https://example.com will include the following request headers in case the user agent sets `numberingSystem`.

```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Sec-CH-Locale-Extensions-NumberingSystem: "native" 
```

4. The server can then tailor the response accordingly. For example, if the current locale is `hi-IN`, the server could provide content with numbers represented using Devanagari numerals. 

Note that servers **must** ignore hints that they do not support. 
</div>

## JavaScript API 

These client hints should also be exposed as JavaScript APIs via `navigator.locales`, or by creating a new `navigator.localeExtensions` property.

### IDL 

```
dictionary LocaleExtensions {
  DOMString measurementUnit;
  DOMString numberingSystem;
  DOMString hourCycle;
};

interface mixin NavigatorLocaleExtensions {
  readonly attribute LocaleExtensions localeExtensions;
};

Navigator includes NavigatorLocaleExtensions;
WorkerNavigator includes NavigatorLocaleExtensions;
```

### Proposed Syntax

```js

navigator.localeExtensions['numberingSystem'];
navigator.localeExtensions.numberingSystem;
self.navigator.localeExtensions.numberingSystem;
// Output => => "latn"

navigator.localeExtensions['measurementUnit'];
navigator.localeExtensions.measurementUnit;
self.navigator.localeExtensions.measurementUnit;
// Output => => "celcius"

navigator.localeExtensions['hourCycle'];
navigator.localeExtensions.hourCycle;
self.navigator.localeExtensions.hourCycle;
// Output => => "h11"

// Window or WorkerGlobalScope event

window.onlocaleextensions = (event) => {
  console.log('localeextensions event detected!');
};

// Or

window.addEventListener('localeextensions', () => {
  console.log('localeextensions event detected!');
});

```

## Privacy and Security Considerations

There are two competing requirements at play when localizing content in the potentially hostile web environment. One is the need to make content and applications accessible and usable to users from as broad a range of linguistic and cultural contexts as possible. The other, equally important, is the need to preserve the safety and privacy of users. Often these two pressures appear diametrically opposed, particularly since proactive content negotiation inevitably requires revealing information that can be used to uniquely identify users.

The [Mitigating Browser Fingerprinting in Web Specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/#fingerprinting-mitigation-levels-of-success) W3C document identifies the following key elements for fingerprint mitigation: 

1. Decreasing the fingerprinting surface
2. Increasing the anonymity set
3. Making fingerprinting detectable (i.e. replacing passive fingerprinting methods with active ones) 
4. Clearable local state


As noted in the [Security Considerations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8942#section-4) section of the HTTP Client Hints RFC, a key benefit of the Client Hints architecture is that it allows for proactive content negotiation without exposing passive fingerprinting vectors, becuase servers must actively advertise their use of specific Client Hints headers. This makes it possible to remove preexisting passive fingerprinting vectors and replace them with relatively easily detectable active vectors. The Detectability section of [Mitigating Browser Fingerprinting in Web Specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/fingerprinting-guidance/#detectability) describes instituting requirements for servers to advertise their use of particular data as a best practice, and mentions Client Hints as a tool for implementing this practice.  

The use of the `Sec-` prefix forbids access to headers containing `Locale Extensions` information from JavaScript, and demarcates them as browser-controlled client hints so that they can be documented and included in requests without triggering CORS preflights. 


This proposal builds on the potential privacy benefits provided by Client Hints by restricting the available set of locale extension headers to a selection that only exposes low-granularity information. This results in a relatively small reduction of the size of the user's anonymity set. Both `hourCycle` and `measurementUnit` have three options apiece, as does `numberingSystem`, due to the reduction of available numbering system options to just "latn", "native", and "auto." This reduction allows users to choose between up to three numbering systems that are likely to be legible to them, without allowing for selections that are highly likely to uniquely identify users.

Implementations may also include other fingerprinting mitigations. For example, clients could restrict the number of Locale Extensions Client Hints sent by users who already have a small anonymity set, with preference given to sending those headers most likely to impact content intelligibility. This ensures that as many users as possible can take advantage of these localization features without making themselves individually identifiable. 

As in all uses of Client Hints, user agents must clear opt-in Client Hints settings when site data, browser caches, and cookies are cleared.
